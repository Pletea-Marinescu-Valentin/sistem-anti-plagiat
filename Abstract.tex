Academic integrity represents a fundamental challenge in modern education systems, 
with plagiarism rates increasing globally across all educational levels. Traditional 
exam monitoring approaches rely primarily on screen surveillance and human oversight, 
creating significant vulnerabilities in detecting sophisticated cheating behaviors 
during online and remote examinations.
This research develops a comprehensive anti-plagiarism monitoring system using 
machine learning and computer vision technologies to address these limitations. 
The system integrates gaze tracking algorithms with YOLO-based object detection 
models through a modular software architecture that combines facial landmark 
detection with real-time behavioral analysis. Algorithms continuously analyze 
candidate gaze patterns while convolutional neural networks detect unauthorized objects 
and suspicious materials, processing video streams using optimized OpenCV libraries.
Experimental testing demonstrates effective operation on standard CPU-based 
systems, identifying suspicious gaze patterns, unauthorized devices, 
and anomalous behaviors while maintaining real-time performance. The system 
achieved detection capabilities during controlled testing scenarios. This research 
provides an open-source solution for educational institutions, enabling 
widespread deployment using standard computing hardware without requiring specialized equipment.

\section{Introduction}

Academic integrity represents a cornerstone of quality education, with educational 
institutions worldwide facing challenges in maintaining fair assessment 
practices. The proliferation of digital learning environments has amplified concerns 
about academic misconduct, with studies indicating that plagiarism rates have increased 
across all educational levels\cite{zimba2021plagiarism}. Traditional 
examination monitoring approaches present limitations 
in detecting cheating behaviors, particularly in remote and hybrid 
learning contexts\cite{nazari2019detection}.

The context of plagiarism in educational settings has evolved with 
technological advancement. Research demonstrates that academic dishonesty affects 
educational quality, credibility, and institutional reputation\cite{pelican2021plagiat}. 
Current statistics reveal trends, with some regions reporting plagiarism 
detection rates exceeding 26\% of submitted academic works, nearly double the global 
average\cite{brainard2018massive}. This issue necessitates 
technological intervention to preserve educational standards and ensure 
assessment environments.

The problem this research addresses lies in the limitations of existing monitoring 
solutions, which rely on manual supervision and screen-based surveillance. 
Traditional approaches fail to detect physical cheating behaviors, such as unauthorized 
device usage or suspicious gaze patterns, creating vulnerabilities in examination 
integrity\cite{dilini2021cheating}. While machine learning solutions exist for plagiarism 
detection\cite{russell2020artificial}, most require computational resources 
including GPU acceleration, making them inaccessible to many educational institutions 
with limited hardware infrastructure.

Recent advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence have opened 
possibilities for automated monitoring systems. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness 
of facial detection algorithms in real-time applications\cite{hasan2021face}, while 
research in eye-tracking technology has shown results for behavioral analysis 
in educational contexts\cite{el2023drowsiness}. Furthermore, object detection technologies, 
particularly YOLO architectures, have revolutionized real-time identification 
capabilities\cite{wang2022object}, making them suitable for detecting unauthorized 
devices in examination environments.

Educational technology integration has become sophisticated, with 
systems incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance assessment integrity\cite{honorlock2023detecting}. 
However, most existing commercial solutions require computational resources 
or rely on external cloud processing, limiting their accessibility to institutions 
with constrained infrastructure\cite{proctoru}. This technological gap highlights 
the need for efficient, locally-processed solutions that can operate on standard 
hardware while maintaining detection accuracy.

This paper presents an anti-plagiarism monitoring system that operates 
on standard CPU-based hardware, requiring minimal computational resources 
while maintaining detection accuracy. The system demonstrates 
real-time performance on hardware configurations, including Intel i5 7th 
generation processors, making monitoring technology accessible to institutions 
regardless of their technical infrastructure limitations.

The structure of this paper proceeds as follows: Section II reviews fundamental 
concepts and related work in computer vision and object detection. Section III 
presents the system architecture and methodology. Section IV details the implementation 
approach and challenges. Section V evaluates system performance and presents experimental 
results. Section VI discusses findings and comparisons with existing solutions, 
followed by conclusions and future work directions in Section VII\@.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Computer Vision Fundamentals}

Computer vision technologies form the foundation of modern automated monitoring systems. 
Facial detection algorithms, particularly those utilizing Histogram of Oriented Gradients 
(HOG) features, have demonstrated robust performance in real-time applications\cite{hasan2021face}. 
These algorithms analyze gradient information within image regions to identify distinctive 
facial characteristics, enabling reliable face localization even under varying lighting conditions.

Gaze tracking represents a critical component in behavioral analysis systems. Recent advances 
in eye-tracking technology have enabled accurate estimation of viewing direction through 
pupil position analysis and facial landmark detection\cite{dilini2021cheating}. These systems 
utilize geometric relationships between eye features to calculate horizontal and vertical 
gaze ratios, providing precise directional information for behavioral assessment\cite{el2023drowsiness}.

\subsection{Object Detection Technologies}

You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures have revolutionized real-time object detection 
applications. YOLO algorithms process entire images in single forward passes, enabling 
rapid detection of multiple object categories simultaneously\cite{wang2022object}. The 
latest YOLOv8 implementations demonstrate superior performance in detecting small objects 
and maintaining accuracy across diverse environmental conditions\cite{v7labs2023yolo}.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide the underlying architecture for modern object 
detection systems\cite{goodfellow2016deep}. These networks excel at feature extraction 
and pattern recognition, enabling identification of unauthorized devices such as mobile 
phones and smartwatches in examination environments. The hierarchical feature learning 
capabilities of CNNs make them particularly effective for distinguishing between similar 
object categories\cite{paszke2019pytorch}.

\subsection{Educational Technology Integration}

Modern educational monitoring systems increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence 
to enhance assessment integrity\cite{russell2020artificial}. Recent research has demonstrated 
the effectiveness of automated proctoring solutions in detecting various forms of academic 
misconduct\cite{honorlock2023detecting}. However, most existing solutions require significant 
computational resources or rely on external cloud processing, limiting their accessibility 
to institutions with constrained infrastructure.

\section{System Architecture and Methodology}

\subsection{Modular System Design}

The proposed anti-plagiarism monitoring system employs a modular architecture comprising 
five primary components: facial detection, gaze analysis, object detection, violation 
monitoring, and report generation. This modular approach enables independent optimization 
of each subsystem while maintaining seamless integration through standardized interfaces.

The facial detection module serves as the primary behavioral analysis component, responsible 
for identifying human faces within the video stream and extracting facial landmarks necessary 
for subsequent analysis. The gaze analysis module processes facial landmark data to determine 
the direction of the candidate's attention, distinguishing between normal examination behavior 
and potentially suspicious activities.

The object detection framework operates independently to identify unauthorized devices 
within the examination environment. The violation monitoring system aggregates information 
from both behavioral and object detection modules to determine when examination rules have 
been violated. Finally, the report generation module creates comprehensive documentation 
of the monitoring session.

\subsection{Gaze Analysis Subsystem}

The gaze analysis subsystem represents the core behavioral monitoring component of the 
architecture. This module processes facial landmark data to determine viewing direction 
through geometric analysis of eye positioning relative to facial structure. The subsystem 
incorporates compensation mechanisms for natural head movements to distinguish between 
intentional gaze direction changes and normal physiological behavior.

The module architecture supports real-time analysis while maintaining computational efficiency. 
Head orientation compensation ensures accurate detection across varying candidate positions 
and natural movement patterns. The subsystem provides directional classification capabilities 
for left, right, center, and downward gaze orientations.

\subsection{Object Detection Framework}

The object detection component utilizes specialized recognition models to identify unauthorized 
devices within the examination environment. The framework employs separate detection pathways 
for different device categories, enabling optimized recognition thresholds and reduced 
classification errors.

The architecture supports real-time processing through intelligent frame selection strategies 
that balance detection accuracy with computational efficiency. The framework processes video 
streams at optimized intervals while maintaining continuous monitoring capabilities for 
immediate violation detection.

\subsection{Integration and Communication Architecture}

The system architecture implements a publisher-subscriber communication pattern that enables 
asynchronous coordination between detection modules and the central violation monitoring 
system. This architectural approach ensures system responsiveness while accommodating 
varying processing requirements across different detection algorithms.

The violation monitoring module serves as the central coordination point, aggregating 
detection results from multiple independent sources. The module applies temporal analysis 
to reduce false positive detections caused by brief, natural movements while maintaining 
sensitivity to genuine violations.

\subsection{System Architecture Diagrams and Operational Analysis}

To illustrate the system structure and operation, two complementary UML diagrams have been developed: the activity diagram and sequence diagram. These representations offer different perspectives on the architecture, from operational flow to temporal component interactions.

\subsubsection{Activity Diagram and Operational Flow}

The activity diagram presents the comprehensive operational flow of the anti-plagiarism system, illustrating decision points and parallel processing capabilities that distinguish this implementation from conventional monitoring solutions.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Activity diagram of the Anti-Plagiarism system with parallel processing flows}
\end{figure}

The activity diagram demonstrates the operational flow beginning with system 
initialization through Start Monitoring, triggered when users activate monitoring 
through the graphical interface. The Initialize Camera process configures capture 
parameters and establishes webcam connectivity, implementing error handling through 
the Available decision point.

Camera availability verification prevents system crashes 
when hardware is unavailable. Failed initialization triggers Display Error, 
routing directly to resource cleanup, while initialization advances to 
Capture Frame for video stream processing.

Frame validation through Valid ensures data integrity. Invalid frames 
activate Skip Frame, maintaining system responsiveness while avoiding processing 
corrupted data.

\textbf{Parallel Processing Architecture:} The system's innovation emerges after 
frame validation, where processing branches into two independent parallel streams:

\textit{Behavioral Analysis Stream:} Executes Face Detection using dlib's 68-point 
facial landmark detection, followed by Check Gaze implementing the horizontal 
and vertical ratio algorithms. The Suspicious decision evaluates gaze direction 
against configurable thresholds, generating Gaze Alert for violations.

\textit{Object Detection Stream:} Processes Detect Objects using 
dual YOLOv8 models for mobile phones and smartwatches. The Detected decision 
applies confidence thresholds (0.55 for phones, 0.4 for watches), producing Object Alert 
for unauthorized devices.

This parallel architecture enables analysis of different violation vectors, 
improving detection coverage while maintaining computational efficiency. 
Both streams converge at Save Frame, where processed data is archived with 
temporal synchronization.

Update Interface refreshes the display through PyQt5 signals, providing real-time 
feedback to supervisors. The Continue decision implements the monitoring loop, 
returning to Capture Frame for sustained operation or advancing to cleanup procedures.

\subsubsection{Sequence Diagram Analysis}

The sequence diagram reveals temporal interactions between system components, illustrating 
message passing and activation patterns critical for real-time operation.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Sequence diagram showing temporal component interactions}
\end{figure}

The sequence analysis reveals three distinct phases: initialization, continuous monitoring 
loop, and controlled termination. During initialization, the GUI triggers cascading component 
activation through the main system controller, establishing the publisher-subscriber 
communication pattern essential for asynchronous processing.

The monitoring loop demonstrates the system's real-time capabilities, with VideoHandler 
continuously providing frames to both FaceDetector and ObjectDetector simultaneously. 
This parallel processing, evident in the concurrent activation bars, enables the system 
to maintain sub-100ms response times while processing multiple detection algorithms.

Critical to the design is the asynchronous return path from ViolationMonitor to GUI, 
implementing the signal-slot mechanism of PyQt5. This ensures interface responsiveness 
remains independent of detection processing times, preventing UI freezing during intensive 
computational periods.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Technology Stack and Platform Compatibility}

The implementation leverages Python as the primary development language, chosen for its 
extensive computer vision library ecosystem and rapid prototyping capabilities. The system 
demonstrates excellent cross-platform compatibility, operating efficiently on both Windows 
and Linux (Ubuntu) environments without modification to the core functionality.

\textbf{Windows Platform Performance:} On Windows systems, the application benefits from 
enhanced performance through CUDA acceleration when NVIDIA GPUs are available. This GPU 
support provides approximately 40\% improvement in processing speed for object detection 
tasks. The Windows implementation takes advantage of optimized driver management and CUDA 
toolkit integration, allowing the system to leverage hardware acceleration for both YOLOv8 
model inference and OpenCV operations.

\textbf{Linux Platform Compatibility:} The system operates effectively on Linux distributions, 
particularly Ubuntu, maintaining full functionality through CPU-based processing. While 
GPU acceleration via CUDA is not yet fully implemented on Linux due to differences in 
driver management and CUDA installation procedures, the optimized algorithms ensure 
acceptable performance levels for real-time monitoring requirements. Linux deployment 
benefits from the platform's stability and resource management capabilities, making it 
suitable for institutional server environments.

\subsection{Advanced Gaze Analysis Implementation}

The gaze analysis implementation employs mathematical algorithms for determining 
viewing direction through pupil position analysis. The system calculates horizontal and 
vertical ratios based on pupil coordinates relative to eye boundaries, incorporating head 
orientation compensation to distinguish between natural movements and suspicious behavior patterns.

The horizontal ratio calculation determines if the candidate is looking left or right. 
This algorithm processes pupil positions and includes adjustment components for head orientation:

\begin{equation}
HR = \frac{LP_{pos} + RP_{pos}}{2}
\end{equation}

where HR represents horizontal ratio, LP denotes left pupil, RP denotes right pupil, and:
\begin{align}
LP_{pos} &= \frac{LP_x}{(LE_{center,x} \times 2 - 10)} \\
RP_{pos} &= \frac{RP_x}{(RE_{center,x} \times 2 - 10)}
\end{align}

where LE and RE represent left eye and right eye respectively.

The system incorporates head orientation compensation through position factor analysis. 
When facial landmarks are available, the algorithm calculates:

\begin{equation}
PF = \frac{ED}{FW \times 0.3}
\end{equation}

where PF represents position factor, ED denotes eye distance, and FW represents frame width.

This factor enables distinction between intentional gaze direction changes and natural 
head movements. The algorithm applies adaptive adjustments:

If $PF < 0.8$: head turned left → $HR_{adj} = \max(0.6, HR)$  

If $PF > 1.2$: head turned right → $HR_{adj} = \min(0.4, HR)$

Similarly, vertical ratio calculation determines downward gaze orientation. The algorithm 
processes vertical pupil positions with head inclination compensation:

\begin{equation}
VR = \frac{LP_{pos,y} + RP_{pos,y}}{2}
\end{equation}

where VR represents vertical ratio.

Head inclination analysis incorporates facial geometry estimation:
\begin{align}
FH &= |EC_y - MP| \\
IF &= \frac{|EO_y - EC_y|}{FH}
\end{align}

where FH represents face height, EC denotes eye center, MP represents mouth position, 
IF represents inclination factor, and EO denotes eye origin.

These calculations enable gaze direction detection across varying lighting conditions 
and head orientations, achieving over 90\% accuracy for distinct directional movements 
under standard conditions.

\subsection{Dual YOLOv8 Architecture Implementation}

The object detection framework employs sophisticated model specialization, with separate 
confidence thresholds optimized through empirical testing\cite{ultralytics}. The mobile 
phone detection model operates at 0.55 confidence, balancing sensitivity with false positive 
reduction. The smartwatch model utilizes 0.4 confidence, accommodating smaller detection 
targets while maintaining accuracy through secondary validation based on dimensional characteristics.

Post-detection processing implements dimension-based classification refinement, analyzing 
detected object aspect ratios and size characteristics. This approach improves distinction 
between device categories, reducing misclassification rates by approximately 15\% compared 
to single-model implementations\cite{redmon2018yolov3}.

\subsection{Core Library Integration and Optimization}

\textbf{OpenCV Implementation:} The OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision Library) 
serves as the foundation for all image processing operations\cite{hasan2021face}. Video 
capture is achieved through the VideoCapture function, which interfaces directly 
with webcam hardware. The cvtColor function converts color images to grayscale, 
reducing computational complexity by processing single-channel data instead of three-channel 
RGB, improving facial detection performance.

Gaussian filtering implementation utilizes cv2.GaussianBlur with 7×7 kernels 
for noise reduction in eye region analysis. The standard deviation is automatically calculated 
using the formula:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = 0.3 \times \left(\frac{kernel\_size - 1}{2} - 1\right) + 0.8
\end{equation}

resulting in $\sigma = 1.4$ for 7×7 kernels. This configuration provides balance 
between noise reduction and edge preservation for pupil detection.

The cv2.minMaxLoc function enables pupil localization by identifying 
minimum intensity points within isolated eye regions. This approach proves robust across 
varying lighting conditions when combined with Gaussian pre-filtering. Visual feedback 
is implemented through cv2.circle for pupil highlighting and cv2.rectangle 
for object detection visualization.

\textbf{Dlib Facial Landmark Detection:} The dlib.get\_frontal\_face\_detector 
initializes HOG-based face detection, optimized for real-time performance. The 
dlib.shape\_predictor loads pre-trained models for 68-point facial landmark 
extraction. Points 36--47 define eye contours, enabling eye region 
isolation for subsequent gaze analysis. The shape.part function provides coordinate 
access for each landmark, facilitating geometric calculations for head orientation and 
gaze direction estimation.

\textbf{PyTorch and YOLOv8 Integration:} Model loading utilizes torch.load for 
pre-trained YOLOv8 weights, with separate models optimized for mobile phones and smartwatches. 
The model.predict method processes video frames with configurable confidence 
thresholds (0.55 for phones, 0.4 for watches). Frame processing optimization reduces 
computational load by analyzing every 20th frame while maintaining continuous facial monitoring.

\subsection{Real-time Optimization Implementation}

Performance optimization represents a critical aspect of the implementation, enabling 
operation on standard CPU-based hardware. The system employs several sophisticated 
optimization techniques:

\textbf{Frame Processing Optimization:} The system implements intelligent frame skipping 
strategies, processing object detection on every 20th frame while maintaining continuous 
facial analysis. This approach reduces computational load by approximately 95\% for object 
detection while preserving real-time responsiveness for behavioral monitoring.

\textbf{Memory Management:} Circular buffering mechanisms prevent memory accumulation 
during extended monitoring sessions. The buffer maintains a fixed-size queue of processed 
frames, automatically disposing of oldest entries when capacity limits are reached.

\textbf{Cache Implementation:} Alert caching eliminates duplicate notifications while 
preserving detection history. The system maintains temporal filtering with minimum intervals 
between similar alerts, reducing false positive rates by up to 40\%.

\subsection{Facial Landmark Integration and Pupil Detection}

The system leverages dlib's 68-point facial landmark detection for precise eye region 
isolation\cite{el2023drowsiness}. Points 36--47 define eye contours, enabling accurate 
pupil localization through polygonal masking and Gaussian filtering. The minimum intensity 
point detection method proves robust across diverse facial orientations and lighting conditions.

The gaze analysis algorithms implement head orientation compensation through position factor 
analysis, distinguishing intentional gaze direction changes from natural head movements. 
This compensation mechanism reduces false positive rates by up to 30\% in realistic 
examination environments.

\subsection{Violation Monitoring and Temporal Correlation}

The ViolationMonitor class implements temporal filtering, maintaining minimum 
intervals between similar alerts to prevent notification flooding\cite{pythondatetime}. 
Alert generation includes confidence scoring and contextual information, enabling supervisors 
to prioritize responses based on violation severity and frequency.

Temporal synchronization between video frames and detected events utilizes timestamps, 
ensuring correlation for subsequent analysis. This synchronization 
is critical for post-examination review and dispute resolution\cite{pythonlogging}.

\section{Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis}

\subsection{Comprehensive Testing Methodology}

System evaluation employed rigorous testing protocols across multiple hardware configurations 
and environmental conditions. Testing platforms included Intel i5 7th generation processors 
with 8GB RAM, representing typical institutional computing resources available in educational 
environments.

\textbf{Environmental Testing Scenarios:} Evaluation encompassed various operational conditions 
including multiple lighting configurations (natural sunlight, artificial fluorescent, 
mixed environments), different camera angles (0°, 15°, 30° deviations from optimal positioning), 
varying distances from camera (50cm to 150cm representing typical examination setups), 
and diverse participant demographics accounting for facial characteristic variations.

\subsection{Quantitative Performance Results}

\textbf{Gaze Detection Performance Metrics:}
-- Horizontal gaze detection achieved 92\% accuracy for left/right movements under 
standard conditions
-- Vertical gaze detection demonstrated 89\% accuracy for downward orientation 
detection
-- Center gaze recognition maintained 94\% accuracy across varied lighting 
conditions
-- Processing latency averaged 15--25ms per frame on target hardware 
configurations

\textbf{Object Detection Accuracy Results:}
-- Mobile phone identification reached 85\% accuracy with 4\% false positive rate
-- Smartwatch detection achieved 82\% accuracy with 3\% false positive rate
-- Combined object detection latency measured 50--80ms per processed frame
-- Dimensional classification refinement improved accuracy by 15\% over baseline 
models

\subsection{Comparative Performance Analysis}

Performance benchmarking against existing commercial solutions demonstrates significant 
advantages in accessibility and deployment flexibility\cite{proctoru}\cite{proctorio}\cite{respondus}. 
Cost efficiency analysis shows local processing eliminates per-session fees, reducing 
operational costs by up to 90\% compared to cloud-based solutions like ProctorU 
(15--25 USD per candidate per session).

Privacy protection through local data processing ensures complete institutional control 
over sensitive examination data, addressing privacy concerns associated with cloud-based 
monitoring while maintaining detection accuracy comparable to commercial alternatives.

Infrastructure requirements analysis confirms standard CPU operation enables deployment 
without specialized hardware investments, making advanced monitoring accessible to institutions 
with limited technical resources. This represents a crucial advancement for educational 
institutions operating under budget constraints\cite{pyqt5}.

\section{Discussion and Comparison}

The proposed system demonstrates significant advantages over existing commercial solutions 
in terms of accessibility and deployment flexibility. Unlike ProctorU or Proctorio, which 
require subscription fees and external server connectivity\cite{proctoru}\cite{proctorio}, 
this solution operates entirely on local hardware, eliminating ongoing operational costs.

Behavioral monitoring capabilities exceed those of Respondus Lockdown Browser by incorporating 
physical behavior analysis alongside screen monitoring\cite{respondus}. The dual-detection 
approach (gaze analysis and object detection) provides comprehensive coverage of potential 
cheating vectors while maintaining computational efficiency.

Recent studies in smart device detection have shown the potential for enhanced monitoring 
capabilities, where ``smart watch-based frameworks for real-time mobility assessment and 
monitoring'' could be integrated for improved behavioral analysis\cite{kheirkhahan2018smartwatch}. 
Furthermore, research has demonstrated that modern surveillance systems can effectively 
categorize device usage patterns, which could enhance the precision of unauthorized object 
detection\cite{moshawrab2023value}.
