Academic integrity represents a fundamental challenge in modern education systems, with plagiarism rates increasing globally across all educational levels. Traditional exam monitoring approaches rely primarily on screen surveillance and human oversight, creating significant vulnerabilities in detecting sophisticated cheating behaviors during online and remote examinations.

The system integrates sophisticated gaze tracking algorithms with YOLO-based object detection models through a modular software architecture that combines facial landmark detection with real-time behavioral analysis. Custom algorithms continuously analyze candidate gaze patterns while convolutional neural networks detect unauthorized objects and suspicious materials, processing video streams efficiently using optimized OpenCV libraries.

Experimental testing demonstrates highly effective operation on standard CPU-based systems, successfully identifying suspicious gaze patterns, unauthorized devices, and anomalous behaviors while maintaining consistent real-time performance. The system achieved robust detection capabilities during controlled testing scenarios.

\section{Introduction}

Academic integrity represents a cornerstone of quality education, with educational institutions worldwide facing unprecedented challenges in maintaining fair assessment practices. The proliferation of digital learning environments has amplified concerns about academic misconduct, with studies indicating that plagiarism rates have increased significantly across all educational levels\cite{zimba2021plagiarism}. Traditional examination monitoring approaches, while foundational, present significant limitations in detecting sophisticated cheating behaviors, particularly in remote and hybrid learning contexts.

The context of plagiarism in educational settings has evolved dramatically with technological advancement. Research demonstrates that academic dishonesty affects educational quality, credibility, and institutional reputation\cite{pelican2021plagiat}. Current statistics reveal alarming trends, with some regions reporting plagiarism detection rates exceeding 26\% of submitted academic works, nearly double the global average. This widespread issue necessitates immediate technological intervention to preserve educational standards and ensure equitable assessment environments.

The problem this research addresses lies in the limitations of existing monitoring solutions, which rely heavily on manual supervision and screen-based surveillance. Traditional approaches fail to detect physical cheating behaviors, such as unauthorized device usage or suspicious gaze patterns, creating vulnerabilities in examination integrity. While machine learning solutions exist for plagiarism detection\cite{nazari2019detection}, most require extensive computational resources including GPU acceleration, making them inaccessible to many educational institutions with limited hardware infrastructure.

This paper presents a comprehensive anti-plagiarism monitoring system that operates efficiently on standard CPU-based hardware, requiring minimal computational resources while maintaining high detection accuracy. The system successfully demonstrates real-time performance on modest hardware configurations, including Intel i5 7th generation processors, making advanced monitoring technology accessible to institutions regardless of their technical infrastructure limitations.

The structure of this paper proceeds as follows: Section II reviews fundamental concepts and related work in computer vision and object detection. Section III presents the system architecture and methodology. Section IV details the implementation approach and challenges. Section V evaluates system performance and presents experimental results. Section VI discusses findings and comparisons with existing solutions, followed by conclusions and future work directions in Section VII.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Computer Vision Fundamentals}

Computer vision technologies form the foundation of modern automated monitoring systems. Facial detection algorithms, particularly those utilizing Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, have demonstrated robust performance in real-time applications\cite{hasan2021face}. These algorithms analyze gradient information within image regions to identify distinctive facial characteristics, enabling reliable face localization even under varying lighting conditions.

Gaze tracking represents a critical component in behavioral analysis systems. Recent advances in eye-tracking technology have enabled accurate estimation of viewing direction through pupil position analysis and facial landmark detection\cite{dilini2021cheating}. These systems utilize geometric relationships between eye features to calculate horizontal and vertical gaze ratios, providing precise directional information for behavioral assessment\cite{el2023drowsiness}.

\subsection{Object Detection Technologies}

You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures have revolutionized real-time object detection applications. YOLO algorithms process entire images in single forward passes, enabling rapid detection of multiple object categories simultaneously\cite{wang2022object}. The latest YOLOv8 implementations demonstrate superior performance in detecting small objects and maintaining accuracy across diverse environmental conditions\cite{v7labs2023yolo}.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide the underlying architecture for modern object detection systems\cite{goodfellow2016deep}. These networks excel at feature extraction and pattern recognition, enabling identification of unauthorized devices such as mobile phones and smartwatches in examination environments. The hierarchical feature learning capabilities of CNNs make them particularly effective for distinguishing between similar object categories\cite{pytorch}.

\subsection{Educational Technology Integration}

Modern educational monitoring systems increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence to enhance assessment integrity\cite{russell2020artificial}. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of automated proctoring solutions in detecting various forms of academic misconduct\cite{honorlock2023detecting}. However, most existing solutions require significant computational resources or rely on external cloud processing, limiting their accessibility to institutions with constrained infrastructure.

WebRTC protocols enable real-time multimedia communication in educational applications, providing low-latency video transmission capabilities essential for monitoring systems\cite{sredojev2015webrtc}. These technologies facilitate immediate response to detected violations while maintaining system responsiveness during extended examination periods.

\section{System Architecture and Methodology}

\subsection{Modular System Design}

The proposed anti-plagiarism monitoring system employs a modular architecture comprising five primary components: facial detection, gaze analysis, object detection, violation monitoring, and report generation. This modular approach enables independent optimization of each subsystem while maintaining seamless integration through standardized interfaces.

The facial detection module serves as the primary behavioral analysis component, utilizing dlib facial landmark detection to identify 68 key facial points. These landmarks enable precise isolation of eye regions for subsequent pupil tracking and gaze direction estimation. The module processes grayscale images to reduce computational overhead while maintaining detection accuracy.

\subsection{Gaze Analysis Subsystem}

The gaze analysis subsystem implements sophisticated algorithms for determining viewing direction through pupil position analysis. The system calculates horizontal and vertical ratios based on pupil coordinates relative to eye boundaries, incorporating head orientation compensation to distinguish between natural movements and suspicious behavior patterns.

The horizontal ratio calculation is essential for determining if the candidate is looking left or right. This algorithm calculates the ratio based on pupil positions and includes adjustment components for head orientation:

\begin{equation}
horizontal\_ratio = \frac{left\_pupil\_pos + right\_pupil\_pos}{2}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{align}
left\_pupil\_pos &= \frac{left\_pupil.x}{(left\_eye\_center.x \times 2 - 10)} \\
right\_pupil\_pos &= \frac{right\_pupil.x}{(right\_eye\_center.x \times 2 - 10)}
\end{align}

The system incorporates head orientation compensation through position factor analysis. When facial landmarks are available, the algorithm calculates:

\begin{equation}
position\_factor = \frac{eye\_distance}{frame\_width \times 0.3}
\end{equation}

This factor enables distinction between intentional gaze direction changes and natural head movements. The algorithm applies adaptive adjustments:

If $position\_factor < 0.8$: head turned left → $adjusted\_ratio = \max(0.6, pupil\_ratio)$  

If $position\_factor > 1.2$: head turned right → $adjusted\_ratio = \min(0.4, pupil\_ratio)$

Similarly, vertical ratio calculation determines downward gaze orientation. The algorithm processes vertical pupil positions with head inclination compensation:

\begin{equation}
vertical\_ratio = \frac{left\_pupil\_pos\_y + right\_pupil\_pos\_y}{2}
\end{equation}

Head inclination analysis incorporates facial geometry estimation:
\begin{align}
face\_height &= |eye\_center\_y - mouth\_position| \\
inclination\_factor &= \frac{|eye\_origin\_y - eye\_center\_y|}{face\_height}
\end{align}

These calculations enable robust gaze direction detection across varying lighting conditions and head orientations, achieving over 90\% accuracy for distinct directional movements under standard conditions.

\subsection{Object Detection Framework}

The object detection component utilizes dual YOLOv8 models specialized for identifying unauthorized devices. Separate models for mobile phones and smartwatches enable optimized detection thresholds and reduced false positive rates. The system processes video frames at intervals to balance detection accuracy with computational efficiency.

Real-time processing optimization includes frame skipping strategies, where object detection occurs on every 20th frame while maintaining continuous facial analysis. This approach significantly reduces computational load while preserving system responsiveness for immediate violation detection.

\subsection{Integration and Communication}

Component integration follows a publisher-subscriber pattern, enabling asynchronous communication between detection modules and the central violation monitoring system. This architecture ensures system responsiveness while accommodating varying processing times across different detection algorithms.

The violation monitoring module aggregates detection results from multiple sources, applying temporal filtering to reduce false positives caused by brief, natural movements. Alert generation includes confidence scoring and contextual information to assist human supervisors in validation decisions.

\subsection{Real-time Optimization Strategies}

Performance optimization represents a critical aspect of the system design, enabling operation on standard CPU-based hardware. The implementation employs several sophisticated optimization techniques:

\textbf{Frame Processing Optimization:} The system implements intelligent frame skipping strategies, processing object detection on every 20th frame while maintaining continuous facial analysis. This approach reduces computational load by approximately 95\% for object detection while preserving real-time responsiveness for behavioral monitoring.

\textbf{Memory Management:} Circular buffering mechanisms prevent memory accumulation during extended monitoring sessions. The buffer maintains a fixed-size queue of processed frames, automatically disposing of oldest entries when capacity limits are reached.

\textbf{Cache Implementation:} Alert caching eliminates duplicate notifications while preserving detection history. The system maintains temporal filtering with minimum intervals between similar alerts, reducing false positive rates by up to 40\%.

\textbf{Image Preprocessing Pipeline:} Gaussian filtering with 7×7 kernels reduces noise in eye region analysis while maintaining pupil detection accuracy. The standard deviation is automatically calculated using:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = 0.3 \times \left(\frac{kernel\_size - 1}{2} - 1\right) + 0.8
\end{equation}

For 7×7 kernels: $\sigma = 0.3 \times (3-1) + 0.8 = 1.4$

\section{System Architecture Diagrams and Analysis}

    \caption{Activity diagram of the Anti-Plagiarism system with parallel processing flows}
\end{figure}

The activity diagram demonstrates the sophisticated operational flow beginning with system initialization through \texttt{Start Monitoring}, triggered when users activate monitoring through the graphical interface. The \texttt{Initialize Camera} process configures capture parameters and establishes webcam connectivity, implementing robust error handling through the \texttt{Available?} decision point.

Critical to system robustness, camera availability verification prevents system crashes when hardware is unavailable. Failed initialization triggers \texttt{Display Error}, routing directly to resource cleanup, while successful initialization advances to \texttt{Capture Frame} for video stream processing.

Frame validation through \texttt{Valid?} ensures data integrity, implementing the condition \texttt{if ret and frame is not None} from the video processing module. Invalid frames activate \texttt{Skip Frame}, maintaining system responsiveness while avoiding processing corrupted data.

\textbf{Parallel Processing Architecture:} The system's key innovation emerges after successful frame validation, where processing branches into two independent parallel streams:

\textit{Behavioral Analysis Stream:} Executes \texttt{Face Detection} using dlib's 68-point facial landmark detection, followed by \texttt{Check Gaze} implementing the horizontal and vertical ratio algorithms. The \texttt{Suspicious?} decision evaluates gaze direction against configurable thresholds, generating \texttt{Gaze Alert} for violations.

\textit{Object Detection Stream:} Simultaneously processes \texttt{Detect Objects} using dual YOLOv8 models for mobile phones and smartwatches. The \texttt{Detected?} decision applies confidence thresholds (0.55 for phones, 0.4 for watches), producing \texttt{Object Alert} for unauthorized devices.

This parallel architecture enables simultaneous analysis of different violation vectors, significantly improving detection coverage while maintaining computational efficiency. Both streams converge at \texttt{Save Frame}, where processed data is archived with temporal synchronization.

\texttt{Update Interface} refreshes the display through PyQt5 signals, providing real-time feedback to supervisors. The \texttt{Continue?} decision implements the monitoring loop, returning to \texttt{Capture Frame} for sustained operation or advancing to cleanup procedures.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Sequence diagram showing temporal component interactions}
\end{figure}

The sequence analysis reveals three distinct phases: initialization, continuous monitoring loop, and controlled termination. During initialization, the GUI triggers cascading component activation through the main system controller, establishing the publisher-subscriber communication pattern essential for asynchronous processing.

The monitoring loop demonstrates the system's real-time capabilities, with VideoHandler continuously providing frames to both FaceDetector and ObjectDetector simultaneously. This parallel processing, evident in the concurrent activation bars, enables the system to maintain sub-100ms response times while processing multiple detection algorithms.

Critical to the design is the asynchronous return path from ViolationMonitor to GUI, implementing the signal-slot mechanism of PyQt5. This ensures interface responsiveness remains independent of detection processing times, preventing UI freezing during intensive computational periods.

\subsection{Advanced Implementation Details}

\textbf{Dual YOLOv8 Architecture Implementation:} The object detection framework employs sophisticated model specialization, with separate confidence thresholds optimized through empirical testing\cite{ultralytics}. The mobile phone detection model operates at 0.55 confidence, balancing sensitivity with false positive reduction. The smartwatch model utilizes 0.4 confidence, accommodating smaller detection targets while maintaining accuracy through secondary validation based on dimensional characteristics.

Post-detection processing implements dimension-based classification refinement, analyzing detected object aspect ratios and size characteristics. This approach improves distinction between device categories, reducing misclassification rates by approximately 15\% compared to single-model implementations\cite{redmon2018yolov3}.

\textbf{Facial Landmark Integration and Gaze Analysis:} The system leverages dlib's 68-point facial landmark detection for precise eye region isolation\cite{el2023drowsiness}. Points 36-47 define eye contours, enabling accurate pupil localization through polygonal masking and Gaussian filtering. The minimum intensity point detection method proves robust across diverse facial orientations and lighting conditions.

The gaze analysis algorithms implement head orientation compensation through position factor analysis, distinguishing intentional gaze direction changes from natural head movements. This compensation mechanism reduces false positive rates by up to 30\% in realistic examination environments.

\textbf{Violation Monitoring and Temporal Correlation:} The ViolationMonitor class implements sophisticated temporal filtering, maintaining minimum intervals between similar alerts to prevent notification flooding\cite{pythondatetime}. Alert generation includes confidence scoring and contextual information, enabling supervisors to prioritize responses based on violation severity and frequency.

Temporal synchronization between video frames and detected events utilizes high-precision timestamps, ensuring accurate correlation for subsequent analysis. This synchronization is critical for post-examination review and dispute resolution\cite{pythonlogging}.

\section{Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis}

\subsection{Comprehensive Testing Methodology}

System evaluation employed rigorous testing protocols across multiple hardware configurations and environmental conditions. Testing platforms included Intel i5 7th generation processors with 8GB RAM, representing typical institutional computing resources available in educational environments.

\textbf{Environmental Testing Scenarios:} Evaluation encompassed various operational conditions including multiple lighting configurations (natural sunlight, artificial fluorescent, mixed environments), different camera angles (0°, 15°, 30° deviations from optimal positioning), varying distances from camera (50cm to 150cm representing typical examination setups), and diverse participant demographics accounting for facial characteristic variations.

\textbf{Performance Metrics Collection:} Assessment focused on detection accuracy rates for both gaze direction and object identification, processing latency measurements under sustained operation, comprehensive resource utilization monitoring including CPU, memory, and storage, and detailed false positive and false negative analysis across different scenarios.

\subsection{Quantitative Performance Results}

\textbf{Gaze Detection Performance Metrics:}
- Horizontal gaze detection achieved 92\% accuracy for left/right movements under standard conditions
- Vertical gaze detection demonstrated 89\% accuracy for downward orientation detection
- Center gaze recognition maintained 94\% accuracy across varied lighting conditions
- Processing latency averaged 15-25ms per frame on target hardware configurations

\textbf{Object Detection Accuracy Results:}
- Mobile phone identification reached 85\% accuracy with 4\% false positive rate
- Smartwatch detection achieved 82\% accuracy with 3\% false positive rate
- Combined object detection latency measured 50-80ms per processed frame
- Dimensional classification refinement improved accuracy by 15\% over baseline models

\textbf{System Resource Utilization Analysis:}
- CPU utilization peaked at 60\% during intensive processing periods
- Memory consumption stabilized at 500MB average usage during extended sessions\cite{harris2020array}
- Frame processing rate sustained 15-20 FPS throughout monitoring periods
- Storage efficiency achieved 1GB per hour of recorded examination session

\subsection{Comparative Performance Analysis}

Performance benchmarking against existing commercial solutions demonstrates significant advantages in accessibility and deployment flexibility\cite{proctoru}\cite{proctorio}\cite{respondus}. Cost efficiency analysis shows local processing eliminates per-session fees, reducing operational costs by up to 90\% compared to cloud-based solutions like ProctorU (15-25 USD per candidate per session).

Privacy protection through local data processing ensures complete institutional control over sensitive examination data, addressing privacy concerns associated with cloud-based monitoring while maintaining detection accuracy comparable to commercial alternatives.

Infrastructure requirements analysis confirms standard CPU operation enables deployment without specialized hardware investments, making advanced monitoring accessible to institutions with limited technical resources. This represents a crucial advancement for educational institutions operating under budget constraints\cite{pyqt5}.

\section{Discussion and Comparison}

The proposed system demonstrates significant advantages over existing commercial solutions in terms of accessibility and deployment flexibility. Unlike ProctorU or Proctorio, which require subscription fees and external server connectivity\cite{proctoru}\cite{proctorio}, this solution operates entirely on local hardware, eliminating ongoing operational costs.

Behavioral monitoring capabilities exceed those of Respondus Lockdown Browser by incorporating physical behavior analysis alongside screen monitoring\cite{respondus}. The dual-detection approach (gaze analysis and object detection) provides comprehensive coverage of potential cheating vectors while maintaining computational efficiency.

Compared to research prototypes requiring high-end GPU resources, this implementation successfully demonstrates that effective anti-plagiarism monitoring can operate on standard institutional hardware. This accessibility factor represents a crucial advancement for educational institutions with limited technical infrastructure.

Recent studies in smart device detection have shown the potential for enhanced monitoring capabilities, where "smart watch-based frameworks for real-time mobility assessment and monitoring" could be integrated for improved behavioral analysis\cite{kheirkhahan2018smartwatch}. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that modern surveillance systems can effectively categorize device usage patterns, which could enhance the precision of unauthorized object detection\cite{moshawrab2023value}.
